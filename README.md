# 🌟 Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship – Project Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the projects I worked on during my **Data Science Internship** at **Oasis Infobyte**. This internship provided an excellent opportunity to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and build a strong foundation in machine learning and data analytics.

This repository includes the following three completed tasks:

1. 🌸 [Iris Flower Classification](https://github.com/kartikeVr/OIBSIP/tree/main/Iris_classification)
2. 📧 [Email Classification - Spam or Ham](https://github.com/kartikeVr/OIBSIP/tree/main/email_classification)
3. 🚗 [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/kartikeVr/OIBSIP/tree/main/Car_price_Pred)

## ✅ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **XGBoost** for advanced regression (Car Price)
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** for text processing
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## 1. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

### 🎯 Objective:
To classify the species of an iris flower based on four input features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The dataset consists of 3 classes:  
- Iris Setosa  
- Iris Versicolor  
- Iris Virginica

### 🧠 Steps Performed:
- Imported and explored the Iris dataset.
- Performed data visualization (scatter matrix, pairplot, heatmap).
- Applied preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Trained various models: **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Decision Tree**.
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### ✅ Outcome:
Achieved **>96% accuracy** using KNN and Decision Tree. This project demonstrated the basics of classification and helped in understanding feature importance and evaluation techniques.

## 2. 📧 Email Classification - Spam or Ham

### 🎯 Objective:
To build a machine learning model that classifies emails as:
- **Spam** (unsolicited/junk email)
- **Ham** (legitimate email)

This helps in creating smarter inbox filters to protect against phishing and advertising spam.

### 🧠 Steps Performed:
- Loaded the dataset with labeled spam/ham emails.
- Cleaned text using **NLTK** (removal of stopwords, punctuation, stemming).
- Converted text into numerical format using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Trained models: **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**.
- Evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score.

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- NLTK for text cleaning
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
- Pandas, Seaborn for EDA

### ✅ Outcome:
Achieved **accuracy ~98%** using Naive Bayes. The model effectively identifies spam emails and can be extended to build real-time spam filters.

## 3. 🚗 Car Price Prediction

### 🎯 Objective:
To develop a machine learning model that predicts the **resale value (selling price)** of a used car based on various features such as:
- Present Price
- Kilometers Driven
- Fuel Type
- Number of Owners
- Age of the Car

### 🧠 Steps Performed:
- Performed data preprocessing:
  - Handled categorical variables using Label Encoding.
  - Created new feature `Car_Age` from the Year column.
  - Detected and removed outliers.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Visualized selling price trends across years, fuel types, and owners.
  - Used boxplots, histograms, line plots, and scatter plots.
- Built and compared multiple regression models:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **XGBoost Regressor**
- Evaluated using **R² Score**, **MAE**, **RMSE**.

### 🛠 Tools Used:
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn for ML modeling
- XGBoost for a performance boost

### ✅ Outcome:
- XGBoost Regressor performed best with **R² score > 0.94**.
- The model can assist car resellers or dealerships in estimating fair resale prices.
